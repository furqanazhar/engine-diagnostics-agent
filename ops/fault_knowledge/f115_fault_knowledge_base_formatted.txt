Fault: VST filter clogged / white powder contamination
Model: f115a
Tags: yamaha,f115,68V,outboard

**Technical Brief: VST Filter Clogged / White Powder Contamination**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Hard starting
  - Surging
  - Stalls after throttle
  - Low/erratic rail pressure
  - Wide Open Throttle (WOT) power loss
  - Primer bulb soft
  - Rail pressure drop under load

- **Reported Fix:**
  - Clean VST (Vapor Separator Tank)
  - Replace VST filter and High-Pressure (HP) pump inlet screen
  - Flush fuel tank and lines
  - Install Yamaha 10µm inline filter
  - Consider performing an injector flow test

- **Parts Used:**
  - VST filter (Part No. 68V‑13915‑00)
  - HP pump inlet screen
  - 10µm inline filter (Part No. 68V‑24502‑02‑00)
  - Injector screen kit

- **Preventive Notes:**
  - Drain and clean the fuel tank annually
  - Use high-quality fuel
  - Avoid using stale ethanol fuel
  - Replace the 10µm filter annually
  - Perform periodic VST service

- **Diagnostic Procedure:**
  1. Conduct a rail pressure test: Idle pressure should be approximately 36 PSI; a load drop greater than 4 PSI indicates a restriction.
  2. Check the primer bulb: RPM recovery suggests a Low-Pressure (LP) or VST restriction.
  3. Perform a vacuum test before the VST: A reading greater than 3" Hg indicates a restriction upstream.
  4. Drain the VST and inspect for white/grey silt, rust, or hose debris.
  5. Inspect the HP pump inlet screen for any coating or signs of cavitation.

  - Wide Open Throttle (WOT) fuel starvation.

- **Reported Fix:**
  - Replace anti‑siphon valve.
  - Remove debris in pickup barb.
  - Clean or replace tank vent if contributing.

- **Parts Used:**
  - Anti‑siphon valve.
  - Pickup tube fitting.
  - Ethanol‑safe hose.
  - Vent screen.

- **Preventive Notes:**
  - Replace Anti‑siphon Valve (ASV) every 5 years.
  - Inspect tank vent annually.
  - Avoid leaving fuel to stale.

- **Diagnostic Procedure:**
  1. Squeeze primer bulb at fault—collapsing bulb indicates vacuum in tank/ASV restriction.
  2. Open fuel cap: if engine instantly recovers, it suggests a vent or ASV fault.
  3. Remove ASV and blow through it—sticking or heavy resistance confirms the issue.
  4. Replace ASV and test under load.
