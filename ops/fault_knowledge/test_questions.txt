## Single Fault Questions (Symptoms-based)

1. My engine is hard to start and surges when I give it throttle. What could be wrong?

2. The oil level keeps rising and I smell fuel in the oil. What's causing this?

3. My engine stalls at idle and the idle RPM is erratic. Sometimes it only idles with the throttle cracked open.

4. The engine surges at idle and hesitates when I shift into gear. What should I check?

5. I'm not getting any charging voltage. The voltage regulator connector looks melted. What's the issue?

6. The engine overheats at idle but seems fine at higher speeds. What could cause this?

7. My trim/tilt moves very slowly and makes a labored sound. It works better when the engine is warm.

8. The engine breaks up at high RPM and I'm getting low charging voltage. What's wrong?

9. The engine randomly cuts out and stalls when it gets hot. It won't restart until it cools down.

10. One cylinder keeps misfiring at mid-range and the spark plug is wet. What should I check?

11. I'm getting multiple random electrical issues - ECU resets, weak spark, trim/tilt is intermittent. What's the problem?

12. The engine won't crank. It only cranks when I push the control lever. What could this be?

13. I hear a single click but the starter doesn't turn. The battery is strong. What's wrong?

14. The starter cranks very slowly, especially when the engine is hot. What should I check?

15. One cylinder is dead intermittently. When I wiggle the injector harness, the RPM changes. What's the issue?

16. The engine never reaches operating temperature and uses excessive fuel. What could cause this?

17. The engine runs cool at idle but overheats at cruise or wide open throttle. What's happening?

18. The primer bulb collapses and the engine dies after running at speed. What should I check?

19. When I open the fuel cap, there's a strong vacuum sound. The engine loses power after several minutes.

20. The engine runs fine at idle but stalls at midrange. I see aerated fuel in the clear hoses.

21. I'm losing top-end power and the RPM is stuck 1000-1500 below normal. Fuel rail pressure drops under throttle.

22. The high-pressure fuel pump is silent when I turn the key on. Sometimes it primes, sometimes it doesn't.

23. There's a strong fuel smell at the exhaust and one cylinder runs rich. The spark plug is wet.

24. The main fuse keeps blowing. Sometimes it blows as soon as I turn the key on.

25. The charging voltage fluctuates and the rectifier plug is hot. The tachometer bounces or drops out.

## Multi-Fault Questions (Mixed Symptoms)

26. My engine is hard to start, surges, and I'm also seeing the oil level rise with fuel smell. What could be multiple issues?

27. The engine stalls at idle, overheats, and I'm getting low charging voltage. What are the possible problems?

28. I have erratic idle RPM, the engine overheats at idle, and the trim/tilt is slow. What should I check?

29. The engine won't start, the starter clicks but doesn't turn, and I'm seeing multiple electrical issues. What's going on?

30. I'm experiencing surging, low rail pressure, and the engine dies when shifting into gear. What could be wrong?

31. The engine overheats, stalls at idle, and I'm getting weak charging. Are these related issues?

32. I have hard starting, surging, and the primer bulb collapses. What are the potential causes?

33. The engine runs cold, uses excessive fuel, and I'm seeing fuel dilution in the oil. What should I investigate?

34. I'm getting misfires, weak charging, and the engine cuts out when hot. What are the possible faults?

35. The engine won't crank, I'm getting electrical issues, and the charging voltage is erratic. What's happening?
