GEN  SAFETY WHILE WORKING
# SAFETY WHILE WORKING

The procedures given in this manual are those recommended by Yamaha to be followed by Yamaha dealers and their mechanics.

# FIRE PREVENTION

Gasoline (petrol) is highly flammable. Petroleum vapor is explosive if ignited. Do not smoke while handling gasoline and keep it away from heat, sparks and open flames.

# VENTILATION

Petroleum vapor is heavier than air and is deadly if inhaled in large quantities. Engine exhaust gases are harmful to breathe. When test-running an engine indoors, maintain good ventilation.

# SELF-PROTECTION

Protect your eyes with suitable safety glasses or safety goggles, when grinding or when doing any operation which may cause particles to fly off. Protect hands and feet by wearing safety gloves or protective shoes if appropriate to the work you are doing.

# OILS, GREASES AND SEALING FLUIDS

Use only genuine Yamaha oils, greases and sealing fluids or those recommended by Yamaha.

GEN SAFETY WHILE WORKING

Under normal conditions of use, there should be no hazards from the use of the lubricants mentioned in this manual, but safety is all-important, and by adopting good safety practices, any risk is minimized. A summary of the most important precautions is as follows:

1. While working, maintain good standards of personal and industrial hygiene.
2. Clothing which has become contaminated with lubricants should be changed as soon as practicable, and laundered before further use.
3. Avoid skin contact with lubricants; do not, for example, place a soiled wiping-rag in your pocket.
4. Hands and any other part of the body which have been in contact with lubricants or lubricant-contaminated clothing, should be thoroughly washed with hot water and soap as soon as practicable.
5. To protect the skin, the application of a suitable barrier cream to the hands before working, is recommended.
6. A supply of clean lint-free cloths should be available for wiping purposes.

# GOOD WORKING PRACTICES

1. The right tools
Use the recommended special tools to protect parts from damage. Use the right tool in the right manner – do not improvise.
2. Tightening torque
Follow the tightening torque instructions. When tightening bolts, nuts and screws, tighten the large sizes first, and tighten inner-positioned fixings before outer-positioned ones.

# 3. Non-reusable items

Always use new gaskets, packings, O-rings, split-pins, circlips, etc., on reassembly.

# DISASSEMBLY AND ASSEMBLY

1. Clean parts with compressed air when disassembling.
2. Oil the contact surfaces of moving parts before assembly.
3. After assembly, check that moving parts operate normally.
4. Install bearings with the manufacturer’s markings on the side exposed to view, and liberally oil the bearings.
5. When installing oil seals, apply a light coating of water-resistant grease to the outside diameter.

# SPEC TIGHTENING TORQUES

# GENERAL TORQUES

This chart specifies tightening torques for standard fasteners with a standard ISO thread pitch. Tightening torque specifications for special components or assemblies are provided in applicable sections of this manual. To avoid warpage, tighten multi-fastener assemblies in a crisscross fashion and progressive stages until the specified tightening torque is reached. Unless otherwise specified, tightening torque specifications require clean, dry threads. Components should be at room temperature.

# CHECKING THE BATTERY

# WARNING

Battery electrolytic fluid is dangerous; it contains sulfuric acid and therefore is poisonous and highly caustic.

Always follow these preventive measures:

- Avoid bodily contact with electrolytic fluid as it can cause severe burns or permanent eye injury.
- Wear protective eye gear when handling or working near batteries.

# Antidote (EXTERNAL):

- SKIN - Flush with water.
- EYES - Flush with water for 15 minutes and get immediate medical attention.

# Antidote (INTERNAL):

- Drink large quantities of water or milk followed by milk of magnesia, beaten egg, or vegetable oil. Get immediate medical attention.

Batteries also generate explosive hydrogen gas; therefore, you should always follow these preventive measures:

- Charge batteries in a well-ventilated area.
- Keep batteries away from fire, sparks, or open flames (e.g., welding equipment, lighted cigarettes, etc.).
- DO NOT SMOKE when charging or handling batteries.

# KEEP BATTERIES AND ELECTROLYTIC FLUID OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

# FUEL PUMP

# CHECKING THE FUEL PUMPS

1. Check:
- Diaphragm
- Fuel pump valves

Damage → Replace.
2. Check:
- Fuel pump

Reverse air flow → Replace.

# a Checking steps

NOTE: Do not overpressurize the fuel pump. Excessive pressure may cause air to leak out.

# b

1. (1) Install the Mity vac onto the fuel pump as shown.

Mity vac YB-35956 / 90890-06756

(2) Apply the specified pressure with the Mity vac.

Fuel pump pressure: 50 kPa (0.5 kg/cm², 7.1 psi)

Fuel pump negative pressure: 30 kPa (0.3 kg/cm², 4.3 psi)

NOTE:

- Make sure no air comes out of the opposite side of the fuel pump.
- To eliminate any gaps between the fuel pump valves and the fuel pump body, and to ensure a better seal, make sure the inside of the fuel pump is wet (i.e., with gas).

# SELECTING THE PINION SHIMS

NOTE:

Find the shim thickness (T3) by selecting shims until the specified value (M0) is obtained with the special tool.

1. Measure:

• Specified measurement (M)

Out of specified value (M0) → Adjust.

Specified value (M0) =

1.00 + P/100 mm

# Measuring steps

(1) Calculate the specified value (M0).

NOTE:

“P” is the deviation of the lower case dimension from standard. It is stamped on the trim tab mounting surface of the lower case in 0.01-mm units. If the “P” mark is missing or unreadable, assume a “P” value of “0”, and check the backlash when the unit is assembled.

# Example:

If “P” is “+5”, then

M0 = 1.00 + (+5)/100 mm

= 1.00 + 0.05 mm

= 1.05 mm

If “P” is “–3”, then

M0 = 1.00 + (–3)/100 mm

= 1.00 – 0.03 mm

= 0.97 mm

(5) Calculate the pinion shim thickness (T3).

Pinion shim thickness (T3) =

| R-1 | 62.5 + P/100 – M3 – M4 |
| --- | ---------------------- |
| F+5 | P+2                    |

NOTE:

“P” is the deviation of the lower case dimension from standard. It is stamped on the trim tab mounting surface of the lower case in 0.01-mm units. If the “P” mark is missing or unreadable, assume a “P” value of “0”, and check the backlash when the unit is assembled.

Example:

If M3 is “46.85 mm”, M4 is “15.12 mm” and P is “–5”, then

T3 = 62.5 + (–5)/100 – 46.85 – 15.12 mm

= 62.5 – 0.05 – 46.85 – 15.12 mm

= 0.48 mm

BRKT  RESERVOIR AND POWER TRIM AND TILT MOTOR

# WARNING

- To prevent the hydraulic fluid from spurting out due to internal pressure, the outboard should be kept fully tilted up (the tilt rod at full length).
- After removing the power trim and tilt motor or reservoir, do not push the tilt ram down. This may cause hydraulic fluid to spurt out from the port.

# CAUTION:

Do not wipe hydraulic system components with rags, paper, tissues, or the like, as fibers from such material will cause malfunctions if they enter the system.

# CHECKING THE RESERVOIR

1. Drain:
- Power trim and tilt fluid
2. Check:
- Reservoir
- Cracks/damage/leaks → Replace.

# CHECKING THE GEAR PUMP HOUSING FILTER

Check:

- Gear pump housing filter
- Damage/tears → Replace.
- Foreign matter → Clean.

# DIGITAL CIRCUIT TESTER

Digital tester J-39299 / 90890-06752

# NOTE:

8080 “ ” indicates a continuity of electricity which means a closed circuit at the respective switch position.

# MEASURING THE PEAK VOLTAGE

# NOTE:

- When checking the condition of the ignition system it is useful to know the peak voltage.
- Cranking speed is dependant on many factors (e.g., fouled or weak spark plugs, a weak battery). If one of these is defective, the peak voltage will be lower than specification.
- If the peak voltage measurement is not within specification the engine will not operate properly.

# PEAK VOLTAGE ADAPTOR

# NOTE:

The peak voltage adaptor should be used with the digital circuit tester.

## Document 294


# ELEC – ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS

NOTE:

- When measuring the peak voltage, set the selector to the DC voltage mode.
- Make sure the peak voltage adaptor leads are properly installed in the digital tester.
- Make sure the positive pin (the “+” mark facing up as shown) on the peak voltage adaptor is installed into the positive terminal of the digital tester.
- The test harness is needed for the following tests.

# Measuring steps

1. Disconnect the coupler connections.
2. Connect the test harness between the couplers.
3. Connect the peak voltage adaptor probes to the connectors which are being checked.
4. Start or crank the engine and observe the measurement.

# MEASURING A LOW RESISTANCE

When measuring a resistance of 10 Ω or less with the digital tester, the correct measurement cannot be obtained because of the tester’s internal resistance. To obtain the correct value, subtract the internal resistance from the displayed measurement.

Correct value = Displayed measurement – internal resistance

NOTE:

The internal resistance of the digital tester can be obtained by connecting both of its probes.
