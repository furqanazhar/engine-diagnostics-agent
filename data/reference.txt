I’m developing the most comprehensive AI-powered outboard engine diagnostic system ever built — trained on every single workshop manual ever written and thousands of real-world fault cases gathered from 50 years of marine experience.

I need a talented engineer to structure the database and retrieval system (RAG setup) so the AI can pull brand-specific info and respond like a real marine engineer, not a generic chatbot.

You’ll set up:

A vector database for semantic search (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant).

A PostgreSQL (or similar) metadata layer to store structured info (brand, HP, fuel system, etc).

A clean API layer (FastAPI or Node) that:

Retrieves matching chunks from manuals and real-world data.

Passes that context to the LLM for diagnosis.



If you’ve worked with LangChain or LlamaIndex, even better — but no need for overengineering. Keep it clean, modular, and easy to expand.

for poc we need to provide all info surrounding just a single model of outboard. so we will take the yamaha f115a model for this proof. i will provide you with t3 sources of information - he workshop repair manual, the parts list, and a csv of commonly occurring faults.

Here’s a rough example of the kind of data and queries I have in mind:

Sample “manual chunk” (conceptually):

Engine: Yamaha F90 4-stroke

Section: Torque Specs

Content (example):
“Flywheel nut torque: 145 Nm (14.5 m·kg, 107 ft·lb). Always use a calibrated torque wrench and new tab washer.”

Another example chunk:

Engine: Yamaha F90 4-stroke

Section: Ignition System

Content:
“Ignition coil primary resistance: 0.16–0.24 Ω at 20 °C. Secondary resistance: 3.6–5.4 kΩ. Measure between terminals X and Y as shown in the diagram.”

And a more diagnostic-style chunk:

Engine: Yamaha F90 4-stroke

Section: Troubleshooting – Engine stalls

Content:
“If engine stalls after idling for several minutes but restarts when throttle is opened, likely causes are:

Idle jet / pilot circuit restriction

Air leak at intake gasket

Incorrect idle speed setting.
Check fuel varnish in carburettor, spray around intake gasket for RPM change, and verify idle RPM vs spec.”

Example user queries + expected type of result:

Query:
“On a Yamaha F90, what’s the correct flywheel nut torque?”

Expected response shape:

Answer: “145 Nm (14.5 m·kg, 107 ft·lb)”

Short explanation: “This is from the torque specs section of the F90 workshop manual.”

Source: section/page reference if possible.

Query:
“My Yamaha F90 runs fine at speed but stalls after 5–10 minutes at idle and then restarts if I open the throttle. What should I check first?”

Expected response shape:

Likely causes (ranked: e.g. idle jet restriction, intake air leak, idle speed too low)

3–5 concrete checks (e.g. inspect for varnish, spray-test around intake gasket, check idle RPM vs spec)

Any relevant spec values pulled from the manual if needed.

Query:
“How do I check the ignition coil on this F90 – what resistance values am I looking for?”

Expected response shape:

Primary and secondary resistance ranges

Where to put the meter probes (described in text)

Any cautions (e.g. measure at 20 °C, disconnect connector first).

No need to focus on UI or the image extraction/embeddings
Just text only
Look into MinerU and OLMOCR
Or similar pre processing tools to first extract markdowns

POC but not a proposal. We have to give the client a working solution

We basically have these 3 data sources
And the 2 links here
Filhaal in this POC just focus on these 3
